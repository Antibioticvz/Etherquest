			<p className="text">
				CryptoKitties is a distributed application that runs on the Ethereum network, using specially-developed smart contracts (each, a “Smart Contract”) to enable users to own, transfer, and breed genetically unique digital cats, which can then be visualized on a website that the user can interact with (the “Site”). The Smart Contracts and the Site are collectively referred to in these Terms as the “App”. Using the App, users can view their cats and use the Smart Contracts to acquire, trade, and breed cats with other App users via clock auction.
			</p>
			<p className="">
				Launch Labs, Inc. d/b/a Axiom Zen ("Axiom Zen", "we", or "us") is making the App available to you. Before you use the App, the Smart Contracts, or the Site, however, you will need to agree to these Terms of Use (these “Terms"). PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, OR THE SITE. THESE TERMS GOVERN YOUR USE OF THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, AND THE SITE, UNLESS WE HAVE EXECUTED A SEPARATE WRITTEN AGREEMENT WITH YOU FOR THAT PURPOSE. WE ARE ONLY WILLING TO MAKE THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, AND THE SITE AVAILABLE TO YOU IF YOU ACCEPT ALL OF THESE TERMS. BY USING THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, THE SITE, OR ANY PART OF THEM, OR BY CLICKING “I ACCEPT” BELOW OR INDICATING YOUR ACCEPTANCE IN AN ADJOINING BOX, YOU ARE CONFIRMING THAT YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO ALL OF THESE TERMS. IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO ACCEPT THESE TERMS ON THAT ENTITY’S BEHALF, IN WHICH CASE “YOU” WILL MEAN THAT ENTITY. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, OR IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT ALL OF THESE TERMS, THEN WE ARE UNWILLING TO MAKE THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, OR THE SITE AVAILABLE TO YOU.
			</p>
			<p className="header">
				1. Our CryptoKitties
			</p>
			<p className="">
				A. We have utilized Smart Contracts to develop our initial generation of CryptoKitties (“Gen-Zero cats”). We will release a certain number of Gen-Zero cats “into the wild” (and make them available for purchase) on the day we first launch the App. We will release an additional Gen-Zero cat into the wild every fifteen minutes over course of the next year, and we will make each newly-released Gen-Zero cat available for purchase via a zero-reserve clock auction. Our Smart Contracts enforce a hard limit of 50,000 Gen-Zero cats.
			</p>
			<p className="">
				B. As users breed their CryptoKitties, new and unforeseen generations of CryptoKitties will come into existence! Using our proprietary genetic combination algorithm that we have designed as part of the App, each newly-bred CryptoKitty will have some of the genetic traits of its parents. At the same time, other, new genetic traits may be expressed. Unique and surprising traits may be expressed when CryptoKitties are bred in the right combinations. The Smart Contracts have total control over the pseudo-random elements of our breeding process, which means that we cannot manipulate or influence them.
			</p>
			<p className="">
				C. How you breed your CryptoKitties is entirely up to you. You may breed your own CryptoKitties with one another, or offer to breed your CryptoKitties with other users’ CryptoKitties. Our CryptoKitties have no fixed gender, which means that in any particular breeding transaction, the CryptoKitties’ owners can choose which cat will be the sire, and which will be the matron. When the new kitten is born, it will always be assigned to the owner of the matron cat. The breeding of two CryptoKitties will always produce a kitten.
			</p>
			<p className="header">
				2. The App
			</p>
			<p className="">
				A. To most easily use the App, you must first install the Google Chrome web browser. Once you have installed Chrome, you will need to install a browser extension called MetaMask. MetaMask is an electronic wallet, which allows you to purchase (either directly via Coinbase if you are in the United States, or via other third party sites), store, and engage in transactions using Ethereum cryptocurrency. You will not be able to engage in any transactions on the App other than through MetaMask (or other Ethereum-compatible browsers). The App will only recognize you as a user, and you will only be able to interact with the App, if your Ethereum electronic wallet is connected and unlocked through your MetaMask account. There is no other way to sign up as a user, or to interact directly with the App.
			</p>
			<p className="">
				B. Transactions that take place on the App are managed and confirmed via the Ethereum blockchain. You understand that your Ethereum public address will be made publicly visible whenever you engage in a transaction on the App.
			</p>
			<p className="">
				C. We neither own nor control MetaMask, Coinbase, Google Chrome, the Ethereum network, or any other third party site, product, or service that you might access, visit, or use for the purpose of enabling you to use the various features of the App. We will not be liable for the acts or omissions of any such third parties, nor will we be liable for any damage that you may suffer as a result of interacting with any such third parties.
			</p>
			<p className="">
				D. It is possible for you to interact with the Smart Contracts we have created directly via the Ethereum network, without using the App as a portal. The process for doing so can be quite complex, however. If you do not already know how to do it, you’re probably better off using the Site.
			</p>
			<p className="">
				E. You must provide accurate and complete registration information when you create an account for the App. You are responsible for the security of your MetaMask wallet (and other Ethereum wallets) and for any use of your account, whether you knew about it or not. If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your password or of your account, you agree to notify us immediately at meow@cryptokitties.co.
			</p>
			<p className="header">
				3. Fees and Payment
			</p>
			<p className="">
				A. If you elect to purchase, trade, or breed CryptoKitties on the App, or with or from other users via the App, any financial transactions that you engage in will be conducted through the Ethereum network via via MetaMask. We will have no insight into or control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any transactions. With that in mind, we will have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any transactions that you engage in via the App, or independently using the Smart Contracts.
			</p>
			<p className="">
				B. Ethereum requires the payment of a transaction fee (a “Gas Fee”) for every transaction that occurs on the Ethereum network. The Gas Fee funds the network of computers that run the decentralized Ethereum network. This means that, even if you elect to interact directly via the Ethereum network without using the App as a portal, you will still need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction that occurs via the Ethereum network.
			</p>
			<p className="">
				C. In addition to the Gas Fee, each time you utilize a Smart Contract to conduct a transaction with another user via the App, you authorize us to collect a commission of 3.75% of the total value of that transaction (each, a “Commission”). You acknowledge and agree that the Commission will be transferred directly to us through the Ethereum network as part of your payment. We will not collect a Commission for interactions that do not involve our App marketplace.
			</p>
			<p className="">
				D. As between us, you will be solely responsible to pay any and all sales, use, value-added and other taxes, duties, and assessments (except taxes on our net income) now or hereafter claimed or imposed by any governmental authority (collectively, “Taxes”) associated with your use of the App (including, without limitation, any Taxes that may become payable as the result of your ownership, transfer, or breeding of any of your CryptoKitties). Except for income taxes levied on Axiom Zen, you: (i) will pay or reimburse us for all national, federal, state, local or other taxes and assessments of any jurisdiction, including value added taxes and taxes as required by international tax treaties, customs or other import or export taxes, and amounts levied in lieu thereof based on charges set, services performed or payments made hereunder, as are now or hereafter may be imposed under the authority of any national, state, local or any other taxing jurisdiction; and (ii) shall not be entitled to deduct the amount of any such taxes, duties or assessments from payments made to us pursuant to these Terms.

				Etherquest is a decentralized application built on Ethereum. Each token represents a card—or spell—that you can use to build your deck and defeat your opponent. As an upcoming wizard in the realm, you can learn new spells and build a more powerful deck by practicing invocations. To do so, go to the Invoke tab and select two cards from your inventory. Follow the instructions, and soon enough, you'll have a brand new card, with a different ability. Cards with brighter crystals are more rare, collect them to unlock the most powerful combinations, and become one of the most revered wizard in the realm.
